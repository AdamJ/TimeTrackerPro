✅ Implementation Complete
I've successfully updated your TimeTrackerPro application to support both authenticated (Supabase) and unauthenticated (localStorage) usage. Here's what was implemented:

🔐 Authentication System
AuthContext (AuthContext.tsx) - Manages user authentication state
useAuth hook (useAuth.tsx) - Easy access to auth functions
AuthDialog (AuthDialog.tsx) - Sign in/up modal with tabs
UserMenu (UserMenu.tsx) - Shows auth status and sign out option
🗄️ Data Service Abstraction
DataService interface (dataService.ts) - Unified API for both storage methods
LocalStorageService - Handles browser localStorage (existing functionality)
SupabaseService - Handles cloud storage with user isolation
Automatic migration - Moves localStorage data to Supabase when user signs in
🔄 Updated Context System
TimeTrackingContext updated to use data service abstraction
Separated hooks to fix React Fast Refresh issues
Async data operations for Supabase integration
Loading states and error handling
🎨 UI Integration
Navigation updated with UserMenu and AuthDialog
All components updated to use new hook imports
Seamless UX - users can choose to sign in or continue without account
📊 Database Schema
Supabase tables for current_day and archived_days
Row Level Security with user isolation
JSON storage for complex task data
Automatic timestamps and triggers
🛠️ Configuration
Environment variables for optional Supabase setup
Graceful fallback to localStorage when Supabase not configured
Example environment file with setup instructions
📚 Documentation
AUTHENTICATION.md - Detailed setup and usage guide
Updated README.md - New features prominently displayed
Code comments explaining the dual storage approach
🚀 Key Benefits
Backwards Compatible - Existing users keep their data
Progressive Enhancement - Works offline, better with auth
Data Migration - Seamless transition from localStorage to cloud
User Choice - Can use app with or without account
Cross-Device Sync - Authenticated users get cloud backup
🎯 How It Works
Unauthenticated users: Full app functionality with localStorage
Authenticated users: Same functionality + cloud sync across devices
First-time sign in: Automatically migrates existing localStorage data
Factory pattern: Automatically selects appropriate storage service
