‚úÖ Default Projects Integration Complete
I've successfully integrated your
projects.ts
 file as the initial default projects. Here's what I implemented:

üîß How It Works
Automatic Loading: When the app starts, it automatically loads your default projects from
projects.ts

Smart Merging: The system intelligently merges default projects with any custom projects users have added:

Default projects are always available
Custom projects are preserved
No duplicates are created
Persistent Defaults: Even if users clear their data, the default projects will be restored

üìã Features Added
Default Project Management:

‚úÖ Auto-initialization: Default projects load automatically on first run
‚úÖ Smart merging: Combines defaults with user-created projects
‚úÖ Visual indicators: Default projects show a "Default" badge
‚úÖ Reset functionality: "Reset to Defaults" button to restore original projects
Project Configuration:

‚úÖ Flexible hourly rates: Made hourlyRate optional in the interface
‚úÖ Consistent structure: ProjectCategory matches Project interface
‚úÖ Unique IDs: Automatically generates IDs for default projects
üéØ Your Default Projects
Based on your
projects.ts
:

Component Assembly Systems

Color: Blue (#3B82F6)
Hourly rate: Optional (you can set it in the UI)
CF Data Systems

Color: Purple (#8B5CF6)
Hourly rate: Optional (you can set it in the UI)
üöÄ How to Use
First Time: Your default projects will appear automatically
Add Custom Projects: Use "Add New Project" for additional clients
Edit Defaults: You can edit the default projects (name, rates, etc.)
Reset Anytime: Use "Reset to Defaults" to restore original configuration
Update Config: Modify
projects.ts
 and the changes will apply to new installations
üí° Benefits
Quick Setup: New users get your predefined projects immediately
Consistency: All installations start with the same base projects
Flexibility: Users can still add their own projects
Easy Maintenance: Update the config file to change defaults for new users
Data Safety: User customizations are preserved when defaults are updated
